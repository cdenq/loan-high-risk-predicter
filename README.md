## About Predicting Credit Risk

`Predicting Credit Risk` is a Python machine learning challenge that predicts whether a loan from LendingClub will become high risk or not. The machine learning models used are the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier model.

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans, as well as, buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API.
